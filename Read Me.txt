Fire Emblem 6 World Map Converter by Seinu Fireflower

A word of note about image format, the script supports various image formats(those that pil supports).
I will not list the supported formats however both BMP and PNG are supported both for input and output.
These would be the most likely used for insertion(atleast for Rom Hacking).

Please check the pil documentation for other supported formats!
